# binkNES

binkNES is a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written in C++. Previously called uwuNES because I found that funny, but now it's just an inside joke I'd like to preserve for my sake. 

# CPU
## MOS 6502
The 6502 has: 
- an 8-bit accumulator, 
- 2 8-bit index registers (X and Y), 
- one status register where bit 0 to bit 7 all represent different flags (like Negative, Overflow, Reserved etc.), 
- one 8-bit stack pointer, 
- one 16-bit PC register.

- The stack is implemented using a 256-byte array whose location is hardcoded at page $01 ($0100-$01FF).

- 16 bit addressing space

- Zero page addressing kind of "makes up" for the lack of registers. The CPU doesn't have to spend an additional cycle to fetch another high byte. Instead, it accesses the first 256 bytes of the memory map. For example, $65 will imply 0x65.

- The CPU is little-endian i.e. the least significant byte is placed at the beginning.

- There are also are a few functions: Reset, Sync, NMI (Non-Maskable INterrupt), IRQ (Interrupt Request). 


## Addressing Modes
The 6502 has 151 opcodes. But they are grouped into 56 actual operations or functions. They differ solely by their addressing modes or how the operands/data is fetched. 

- Immediate
- Zero Page
- Zero Page X-Indexed
- Zero Page Y-Indexed
- Indirect X-Indexed
- Indirect Y-Indexed
- Absolute 
- Absolute X-Indexed
- Absolute Y-Indexed

## Executing an instruction
I chose to create a lookup table. Each item in it is an opcode. Within the struct, it has a function pointer to the operation, a function pointer to the addressing mode, and the number of cycles required to execute the instruction.

## Unofficial Opcodes
Usually, most unofficial opcodes execute the equivalent of a NOP (no operation) or they freeze until the Reset button is pressed.

Some have useful effects that games have made use of, but I have not implemented them yet. This is a good page to look at the usable unofficial opcodes: [NESdev](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Programming_with_unofficial_opcodes)

## Clock
An instruction needs a certain number of clock cycles to execute because each cycle executes a microoperation that together forms the complete instruction. 

Much easier to simply just execute the instruction in one go when emulating, so I've decided to do that itself. However clock cycles are important to sync things like the PPU and the CPU, so waiting the required number of clock cycles before executing the next instruction is still important. 

Although, running at NES' native speed would need a cycle-accurate emulator.

## Page Boundaries
A chunk of 256 bytes together is called a page. During certain address modes, like indexed addressing, an offset is added to the operand. As a result, the high byte of the EA might need to be corrected which results in an extra clock cycle. 

# Bus
Buses are simply just wirings between components like the CPU and the memory. Through a bus, the CPU or PPU can read or write to/from the memory. Although, you don't technically need to emulate a bus, I included it because it makes the code a little easier to work with. 

The bus routes interrupts, handles read/writes/memory mapping and coordinates the PPU/CPU timings (super important).

## Mirroring
As mentioned before, the NES tries to be cheap. As a result, there are a few quirks about the system. Mirroring is one used to reduce the hardware needed to decode addresses. And thus, reduce the cost as well.

Mirroring refers to one address space being mapped to another. It happens when some address lines are ignored, leading to a not fully-decoded address. 

Ex: Attempting to access memory at $0173 is the same as accessing memory at $0973, $1173, or $1973 because memory at $0000-$07FF is mirrored at $0800-$0FFF, $1000-$17FF, and $1800-$1FFF.
